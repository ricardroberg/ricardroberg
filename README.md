### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**ricardroberg/ricardroberg** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as Front-end Dev, migrating to Full Stack
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning React JS, Typescript and doing minor work in Java
- ðŸ‘¯ I've also learned a little bit of Python and Django (A long time ago...)
- I'm currently studying Computer Science

- âš¡ Fun fact: IÂ´ve got my first computer at age 11 and it was my first contact with the Basic programming language. But I started working with Dev only from 2021 onwards.
